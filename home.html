                <p id="par1">In the legendary room A-027, a student has achieved what few dare to attempt—complete academic surrender. With syllabus untouched and hopes thoroughly buried, he’s ditched the books and embraced his fate like a true martyr. “Supplementary exams during the vacations? Sounds like a plan,” he shrugs, sipping chai with the serenity of someone who knows salvation is no longer an option. Not even divine powers can bail him out now. A-027 isn’t a room anymore—it’s a monument to defeat, built on dreams and bad CGPA. </p>

                <p id="par2">As endsems descend, a mystical hush blankets the hostel—so profound, you'd think even the walls are too stressed to creak. The once thunderous corridors, echoing with memes and maggi orders, now resemble a haunted library. Not a soul dares to speak above a whisper, lest they break the sacred concentration rituals. It's the kind of eerie peace IIT Guwahati has never known—proof that nothing, absolutely nothing, silences an engineering hostel quite like the sweet terror of exams. </p>

                <p id="par3">In a heartwarming display of academic dedication, our very own student was spotted heroically battling the syllabus—a mere twelve hours before the endsem. With a mountain of untouched notes and eyes full of despair, he managed an impressive 10-minute “study sprint” before gracefully passing out on his desk. Of course, no session is complete without strategic tea breaks every 20 minutes—because caffeine fuels ambition. A true symbol of hostel resilience, he embodies the spirit of “too late, but still trying. </p>
